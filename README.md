# Python-BMI-Calculator

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a simple **BMI Calculator** using Python. The calculator takes user inputs for weight and height, computes the Body Mass Index (BMI) using a standard formula, and provides feedback on the user's weight status.

## Features  
* Input prompts for **weight** (in pounds) and **height** (in inches).
* Calculation of BMI using the formula:

Uses **conditional statements** (if-elif-else) to categorize the user's BMI into:
* Underweight
* Normal weight
* Overweight


##


## How It Works
1. **Input**: The program prompts the user to enter their weight in pounds and height in inches.
2. **Calculation**: The BMI is calculated based on the provided inputs.
3. **Output**: The program evaluates the BMI and displays a message indicating whether the user is underweight, of normal weight, or overweight.
